This course, previously titled APIsec Certified Expert by Corey Ball (author of Hacking APIs), walks through real-world API security testing using intentionally vulnerable applications like crAPI and Vapi. It covers the three types of APIs (public, private, and partner) and dives deep into both passive and active reconnaissance, reverse engineering APIs, automatic documentation with tools like Postman, mitmproxy2swagger, and OWASP ZAP.

## You'll learn how to:

Extract sensitive info via Excessive Data Exposure
Break into user accounts with Auth/Z attacks (BOLA, BFLA, JWT cracking, brute-force)
Exploit Mass Assignment, Rate Limiting, Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, SSRF), and Security Misconfigurations
Use tools like wfuzz, Arjun, Burp Suite, and nikto for fuzzing and scanning
Tweak payloads for WAF bypass using encoding, evasion, and chaining techniques
Conduct asset versioning attacks and detect forgotten/legacy APIs

It’s essentially a complete walkthrough of real-world API hacking techniques based on OWASP API Top 10, combining both theory and tools with hands-on labs and checklists.
